/*The method 1 finds LCA in O(n) time, but requires three tree traversals plus extra spaces for path arrays. If we assume that the keys n1
and n2 are present in Binary Tree, we can find LCA using single traversal of Binary Tree and without extra storage for path arrays.
The idea is to traverse the tree starting from root. If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with root, then root is LCA (assuming 
that both keys are present). If root doesnâ€™t match with any of the keys, we recur for left and right subtree. The node which has one key 
present in its left subtree and the other key present 
in right subtree is the LCA. If both keys lie in left subtree, then left subtree has LCA also, otherwise LCA lies in right subtree.*/

    // Base case 
    if (root == NULL) return NULL; 
  
    // If either n1 or n2 matches with root's key, report 
    // the presence by returning root (Note that if a key is 
    // ancestor of other, then the ancestor key becomes LCA

    // is present in once subtree and other is present in other, 
    // So this node is the LCA
