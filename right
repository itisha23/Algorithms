We are given two unsorted arrays, size can be different we need to swap two elements one from first array and second from second array such that the sum of each individual array becomes equal after swapping.
Eg
int a[] = {4, 3, 5} // 12
int b[] = {9, 1, 6} // 16
Output-{4, 6}
4 from array a and 6 from array b are swapped to get equal sum of each array as 14.
Solution: GeeksforGeeks Link


lets see what can I do:
1. brute force
   calculate sums
   sum = then retrun
   arr1 < arr2
   check for each swap: hash of arr1 elements. sum2 - arr2[i] and then check for each element in arr2 

Third Technical
Few questions from my project.Then he asked me about structure of C program.
Page fault and swap space.

What is Caching?
Implement LRU(Only logic was asked like which data structures you would use and how) and then 2 coding questions
Say you are given a tree and a target node, so we need to restructure the tree when target node becomes the root.(node can have more than 2 child)Keep in mind all the cases.

Eg- target node = 4

Count Inversions in running stream of integers.(I gave answer using bst)

Bar Raiser-

Given initial capital W and n projects and the capital being used in each and the profit earned from each.You need to select k projects out of these n projects such that at the end your capital is maximised.
Eg-
W=3
int capital[] = {9,2,3,1}
int profit[] = {13,5,2,7}
int k = 2
output- 13
Explanation- We choose project with capital 1 and new capital becomes(3+7-1=9)
now we choose project with capital 9 and gets profit of 13 so final capital becomes(9+13-9=13)
I gave answer by initially sorting the array according to capital and then selecting those projects which have capital required less than or equal to initial capital and insert them in max heap, after extracting the top node decrease k and my capital would change and now i can insert new projects from remaining in my max heap which have capital required less than or equal to new capital and repeat this step till k becomes 0.

Verdict-SELECTED ðŸ˜€
